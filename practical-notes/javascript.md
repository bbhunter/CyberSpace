# JavaScript

The console is part of the web browser and allows you to log messages, run JavaScript code, and see errors and warnings. \


#### JS Basics

Example function used to generate output to the console:

```javascript
console.log("Hello Humans!");
```

Enclosed text in quotes:

```javascript
console.log("I love free training");
```

Quotes are not needed for numbers:

```javascript
console.log(1337);
```

The console.log() function can be used as many times as needed:

```javascript
console.log("Hello Humans!");
console.log("Take me to your leader");
```

#### JavaScript in HTML

You can add JavaScript code in an HTML document using the \<script> tag:

```html
<body>
    <script>
      console.log("JavaScript in HTML");
    </script>
</body>
```
